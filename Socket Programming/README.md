# 🔌 Socket Programming – Basics to Advanced  

This project contains everything I learned while mastering **Socket Programming** in Python – from the fundamentals to more advanced concepts.

---

## 📚 Overview  
Socket programming allows two machines to communicate with each other using **sockets** over a network.  
In this project, I’ve documented and coded all my learnings step by step.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned  
Here’s a breakdown of what I covered:

### 🟢 Basics
- Introduction to **Sockets** (What & Why)
- TCP vs UDP
- Understanding **IP addresses** and **Ports**
- Creating your **first server & client**
- Sending and receiving text messages
- Closing sockets properly

---

### 🟡 Intermediate
- Handling **multiple clients** (multi-connection servers)
- Using **Threads** for simultaneous client connections
- Implementing **UDP** communication
- Working with **localhost vs external networks**

---

### 🔴 Advanced
- **Broadcasting** messages to all clients
- Building a **Chat Room** (multi-user chat app)

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Modules used:
  - `socket` (built-in)
  - `threading` (external)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.

### 🖥️ To run (e.g. Project 1):
