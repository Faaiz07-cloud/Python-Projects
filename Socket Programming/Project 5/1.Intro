Blocking Socket:

recv() / accept() wait until data or a connection arrives.
Code execution pauses (freezes) while waiting.
Simple to write and understand.
Handles one client easily, but needs threads/processes for many clients.

Non-Blocking Socket:

recv() / accept() return immediately (error/empty if no data).
Code execution keeps running, never stops.
Requires extra error-handling.
Good for high-performance apps (chat servers, games).
Can handle many clients in a single loop using select/poll/async.

By default, sockets are in blocking mode â€” functions like recv() and accept() will wait
until data or a connection is available.
